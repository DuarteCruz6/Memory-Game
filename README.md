 Extremely hard Memory Game

    Every level the user has 2 additional seconds to memorize the random letters(which can be capitalized or not) + numbers. The level 1 has 3 characters and 5 seconds to guess. You can also make the game extremely hard if you add more characters per level or if you put less seconds per level.

    I acctually made this in a break to study for my finals when a guy came to my house to fix my Tv lol, so if you see anything that can be added, make sure to do create a PR (Pull Request). It can be way better but i did it in 10 min, so, thatÂ´s why i am hoping to get your help!
